# CloudFlare Bulk IP Update Utility

Looking for a way to bulk update IP addresses on CloudFlare?  Well look no further!  This simple script will search and replace an IP address for one domain, multiple domains, or every domain in your account.  You will need to download the CloudFlare-API wrapper located here: https://github.com/vexxhost/CloudFlare-API  Make sure that the class_cloudflare.php file is in the same directory as your update.php file.

The configuration options should be pretty simple, just fill them in and execute the script.  Make sure if you actually want to perform the update you set the $update_records variable to true!

Any questions/problems please let me know!!
